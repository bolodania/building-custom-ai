## 📝Description
In this use case, we will embark on a journey to explore the openness and interoperability between the **SAP HANA Cloud vector engine**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and focusing on the **LangChain** (Python) Framework for developing LLM applications. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills to handle unstructured and semi-structured data and build efficient applications.

Harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) from **SAP Generative AI Hub** to embed structured and semi-structured data. Once embedded, this data is stored in **SAP HANA Cloud**, enabling seamless storage and querying of vector embeddings.
