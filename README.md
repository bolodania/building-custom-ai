## üìùDescription
In this exercise, we will explore how to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine and Knowledge Graph Engine. RAG is a modern and powerful approach to improving the quality of answers generated by large language models (LLMs). Further, we will introduce the hybrid approach that enables the LLM to generate more accurate, comprehensive, and trustworthy responses, making it especially valuable in enterprise applications, customer support, healthcare, legal, and scientific domains where both nuance and factual accuracy matter. You will learn how to use Vector similarity search and SPARQL queries to retrieve and analyze supplier information from both unstructured and structured data.
